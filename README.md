# Ecommerce Project

## Presentation
Hi, i'm Alejandro Olaso and this is an e-commerce project that provides:
- Full front-end and back-end development, as well as the design and implementation of the database.
- Complete user management (registration and login functionalities)
- CRUD operations on multiple models
- Implementation of a REST API to facilitate communication between different parts of the application.


**You can check the fully functional project here:**  
https://alejjaandro-ecommerce-frontend.vercel.app

It might take a moment to charge all the products from the database because the DB is hosted in [vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Requirements
Please check that you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass)

## How To Install
### 1. First clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Alejjaandro/FinalProject.git
```
### 2. Then install both Backend and Frontend dependencies, they are listed below with more info.
Run in each dependency the following command:
```
npm install
```
### 3. Clone database:
Open your terminal on the project main directory and execute:
```
mongorestore -h 127.0.0.1:27017 .\dataBaseCollections\ -d dataBaseCollections
```
You will need [MongoDB Database Tools](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/installation/installation/) to use `mongorestore` command.

### Backend Structure
- Models: Define the structure of the data for a certain object (like users, products, etc.) and interact with the database.
- Routes: Define the endpoints of the API.
- Controllers: Handle the logic for each endpoint.
- Middleware: Handle tasks that should be done before the request hits the controller.

### API Endpoints

The backend provides several API endpoints grouped by their functionality:
1. Auth Routes:

| URL | TYPE | DESCRIPTION | ROLE |

Example of a user document - THIS IS THE DEFAULT ADMIN USER (Password: ***admin123***) - :

```

### Environment Variables

The backend uses the following environment variables:

***On windows there is an error when trying to connect to the database using "mongodb://localhost:27017", so I used "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017" instead.***
- MONGO_URL= URL of your MongoDB database.
- PORT: Port in wich the backend will run.
- JWT_KEY: The secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens.

These should be defined in a .env file in the root directory of the backend, like this:
```
MONGO_URL='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/final_project'
JWT_KEY=secretKey
PORT=8000
```

### Running the Backend

To run the backend, use the following command: 
```
npm start
```
This will start the server at <http://localhost:8000/api>.
